I want you to generate a full-stack project for a "Personal Smart Dashboard" web application. It will be run locally on a VPS (Proxmox container) and accessed remotely using Cloudflare Tunnel. The focus is on modern UI, responsiveness, modular design, and future-ready architecture. Read everything carefully and build the code accordingly.

🔹 Tech Stack Requirements
Frontend: React + TailwindCSS (or Next.js if recommended)
Backend: Node.js + Express
Database: SQLite or PostgreSQL (start with SQLite for convenience)
Auth: Local password login with hashed storage
UI Components: Modern, minimal, glassmorphic/Neumorphism feel
API Layer: REST endpoints for tasks, reminders, subscriptions, car service tracking
Voice Input: Add placeholder voice functionality using Web Speech API for now

🔹 Main Goal

Build a personal dashboard for daily life management:

Task manager + reminders

Bills tracker & due dates

Car service & tyre change schedule

Subscription renewals

Calendar + timeline view

Notes & quick ideas page

AI-ready infrastructure for voice assistant later

🔹 Core Features to Build

Home Dashboard (Main screen)

Overview tiles: Tasks Due Today | Overdue | Bills Upcoming | Car Service Due | Subscriptions Expiring

Weather widget (using public API placeholder)

Quick voice add reminder button (mic icon → text input for now)

Tasks & Reminders

Add / edit / delete tasks

Category support (Work, Home, Business, Bills, Car etc.)

Recurring reminders

Notifications (browser + email triggers later)

Bills & Utilities

Store bill provider name, amount, due date, last paid date

Color highlight when due/overdue

Option to mark paid

Subscriptions

Store renewal date, cost, cycle (monthly/annual)

Dashboard alert when within X days

Graph for yearly cost breakdown

Car Maintenance

Track next service date or km

Track tyre change date

Upload documents (rego, insurance)

Notes Area

Rich text notes

Attach images & receipts

User Profile Settings

Themes (Light / Dark / AMOLED)

Custom category colours

Data export (JSON backup)

🔹 UI Design Guidelines

Follow this visual direction:

Style: Modern – clean – minimal – dashboard layout
Look: Neumorphism / Glassmorphism / Material 3
Components: Cards with soft shadows & rounded edges (2xl)
Colors: Muted grey background + gradient accents
Responsive: Desktop, Tablet, Mobile friendly
Navbar: Sidebar collapsible on desktop, top-nav on mobile
Animations: Smooth transitions & hover effects


Add example layout:

Header: Greeting + Date + Weather
Left Sidebar: Dashboard | Tasks | Bills | Subscriptions | Car | Notes | Settings
Main: Grid cards + upcoming reminders
Footer: Version + local only indicator

🔹 Voice Assistant Stub

Create a button:

🎤 Hold to Speak → converts voice to text → auto opens "Add Task/Reminder" modal


Just implement speech→text using Web Speech API for now.
Agent AI integration field left empty for future.

🔹 Important Rules

The project must be modular & easy to expand.

Store data locally (SQLite DB file).

No external data exposure by default.

Responsive design is required.

Include README with setup instructions.

Deliverables

When generating code:

Full working React + Node project structure

Tailwind ready and configured

Database models & API routes for all modules

Starter dashboard UI

Voice input component for tasks
